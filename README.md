# Plant@net tool - Plant diversity and Citizen Science
Data analytics project based on Plant@net tool large dataset (+12 million entries) on plant diversity collected by citizen science.


## General Information
This project analizes the data gathered by users of the **Plant@net** app from all over the world since 2010 and it is still ongoing. 

The original dataset is comprised of over 12 million entries. For the current project, a random subset of 150.000 entries was used.

## Aims of the project
- Understand the app users' behaviour by analyzing temporal and geographical patterns to (potencially) design future campaings to increase the reach.
- Study plants registered at different levels (order, genus) to plan strategies for gathering information on underrepresented categories.

## Outlook
_Ideas and suggestions for further analysis_

### Plants
- Species identified and urban areas: is there a connection?
- Find patterns in identified plants: urban plants, garden plants, edible.

### Users behaviour
- Find and study information about people with smartphone per region/country and connect it to entries in the app.
- Study correlation between online trends and entries in the app.


## Information about Plant@net
As mentioned in their website:

"Pl@ntNet is a tool to help to identify plants with pictures. It is organized in different thematic and geographical floras. Choose the one that corresponds to your region or area of interest from the list below. If you don't know what to choose, select "World flora" which has the widest coverage but will give less accurate results than a more focused flora."

For more information, check the Plant@net [website](https://identify.plantnet.org/) available in several languages.

### Full dataset
The full dataset, with more than 12 million entries, is available in GBIF.

## Other information
For a better understanding of the regions where the users come from, I used the following information:

### Global internet usage
Gapminder dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/gapminder-internet)

[GapMinder](http://www.gapminder.org/) collects data from a handful of sources, including the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the US Census Bureau’s International Database, the United Nations Statistics Division, and the World Bank.

### Countries list with alpha2 codes

From [dadahub.io](https://datahub.io/core/country-list#resource-country-list_zip)

- ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 English country names and code elements. This list states the country names (official short names in English) in alphabetical order as given in ISO 3166-1 and the corresponding ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code elements.
- This list is updated whenever a change to the official code list in ISO 3166-1 is effected by the ISO 3166/MA.
- It lists 250 official short names and code elements as of Dec 2012.
