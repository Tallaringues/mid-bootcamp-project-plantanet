## Information about Plant@net
As mentioned in their website:
"Pl@ntNet is a tool to help to identify plants with pictures. It is organized in different thematic and geographical floras. Choose the one that corresponds to your region or area of interest from the list below. If you don't know what to choose, select "World flora" which has the widest coverage but will give less accurate results than a more focused flora."

For more information, check the Plant@net [website](https://identify.plantnet.org/) available in several languages.

### Full dataset
The full dataset, with more than 12 million entries, is available in GBIF.
